Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the places I\u0026#39;ve worked have had special entrances.

But still we yearn. This is the God who made us, the God who is all-beautiful and all-glorious—the God we are made for. To be with Him is life and joy and blessedness.
