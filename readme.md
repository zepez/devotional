# âœ¨ Devotional Application

This is the mega-respository for my devotionals application.


## ðŸ¤” Structure

 - frontend - likely a server-side rendered application (nuxt maybe?)
 - backend - api that will interact with web-scraper (written in go and that's all I know so far)
 - [webscraper](https://github.com/zepez/devotional/tree/main/scraper)

## ðŸ–Š Notes

 - this project was started for the intention of leaning go and a new front-end framework
 - all data is scraped from [lhm.org](https://www.lhm.org/)

## âœ… To do

- add more details to readme.md
- start on backend
- start on frontend
