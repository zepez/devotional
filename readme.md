# â€½ Daily Devotional Application

This is the mega-respository for my daily devotionals application.

## ðŸ–Š Notes

 - this project was started for the intention of leaning go and a new front-end framework
 - all data is scraped from [lhm.org](https://www.lhm.org/)
 - this repository will be split into three sections
   - frontend - likely a server-side rendered application (nuxt maybe?)
   - backend - api that will interact with web-scraper (written in go and that's all I know so far)
   - webscraper - written in go using [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery)

## âœ… To do

- add tests to the web-scraper
- add more details to readme.md
- start on backend
- start on frontend
